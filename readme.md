## Abstract

Hibernation is a seasonally regulated process dramatically reducing
metabolic rate and core body temperature (Tb). Most deep hibernators
repeatedly cycle between torpor and arousal (T-A cycling) throughout the
hibernation season. How these cycles are regulated is still unresolved.
The sensing of metabolites accumulating / depleting during torpor may
regulate T-A cycling. Here, for the first time, we develop a protocol to
sample at a high temporal resolution from the 3rd ventricle (3V) of the
hypothalamus, from an individual hibernating golden hamster
(Mesocricetus auratus). Over multiple days and T-A cycles we saw no
negative impact on hibernation physiology or dynamics during the
microdialysis. Validation of the samples collected at 2-hour resolution
over 2 successive T-A cycles by targeted and untargeted metabolomics
provides proof of concept that CSF-microdialysis from the 3V of a
hibernating golden hamster can be used in future studies to understand
regulation of T-A cycling.
